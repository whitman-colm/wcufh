# Uncomplicated File Host
A very simple file host for hosting very simple files.

## About

The Uncomplicated File Host (or UFH for short) is a very simple and very shoddy website for file hosting. It is extremely resource efficient (not because of any clever optimizations or hacks, it just doesn't do much) and could probably run on a potato hooked into ethernet. 

If you are looking at this readme for anything other than morbid curiosity similar to rubbernecking at a car wreck, I urge you to leave now. This system is in everyone's best interest not to use and the only reason I have it on GitHub is because of my loathing of closed-source software (and a backup if my server fails).
